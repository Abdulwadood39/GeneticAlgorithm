# Genetic Algorithms for Feature Selection

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the application of Genetic Algorithms (GA) for feature selection in a machine learning context. The goal is to identify the most relevant features from a dataset that can be used to improve the performance of a predictive model, specifically focusing on the AdaBoost classifier. The process involves several steps, including data preprocessing, encoding, and the implementation of the GA for feature selection.

## Introduction

Genetic Algorithms (GA) are optimization techniques inspired by the process of natural selection. They are used to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems. In the context of feature selection, GAs can help identify the most relevant features from a dataset, which can improve the performance of machine learning models.

## Libraries

The notebook uses several Python libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and sklearn for machine learning tasks and preprocessing.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn import preprocessing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix, recall_score, accuracy_score, f1_score, precision_score, classification_report
```

## Data Loading and Preprocessing

The dataset is loaded from an Excel file and undergoes several preprocessing steps, including renaming columns, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

```python
df = pd.read_excel("Training_Data.xlsx")
df = df.rename(columns={'Depression ': 'Depression'})
df.isna().sum(axis = 0)
df['Depression'].replace(['Depression ', NaN],[1, 0], inplace=True)
df.Race.replace(NaN,'UnKnown', inplace=True)
```

## Feature Selection with Genetic Algorithms

The GA is implemented to select the most relevant features from the dataset. The process involves populating chromosomes, performing crossover and mutation operations, and training a model on the selected features to evaluate their performance.

```python
def GA(DF, ChromoCount = 40, iterations = 300):
    # Implementation of GA for feature selection
    pass
```

## Results

The selected features and their performance are displayed at the end of the notebook. The GA process iteratively refines the selection of features, aiming to maximize the accuracy of the AdaBoost classifier.

```python
columns = np.array(df.columns)
selectedColumns = columns[selected == 1]
print(f'The Selected Columns are:\\n{selectedColumns} \\n Accuracy:{ACCURACY}')
```

This notebook provides a practical example of how GAs can be used for feature selection in machine learning, potentially improving model performance by focusing on the most relevant features.
